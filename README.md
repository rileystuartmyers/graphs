# graphs
Taking a list of node coordinates, creates a graph matrix that allows for cycle tracing.

Inputs take the form of 'A B', with A being a starting/initial node, and B representing the node A is pointing to. 
Relationships between nodes have direction, and so cycles will only be checking based on the order of A and B nodes in the input. 

Output will consist of a 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' answer depending on if the graph contains a cycle.
